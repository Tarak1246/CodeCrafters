# User Story

**Title:** Users

**Description:**

In order to control user access and rights within the system, I, as the system administrator, would like to examine and update user information, including username, email, status, role, and admin privilege.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. I can see a table listing all registered users with the following information:
    Username
    Email
    Status (e.g., active, inactive)
    Role (e.g., admin, manager, user)
    Admin privilege (Yes/No).
2. If I have administrator privileges, I can alter any user's data.
3. Using the edit user form, I can:
    - View user details (name, email, role, status, admin privilege) for the current user.
    - Modify the user's status (for example, turning on or off).
    - Modify the user's role (assigning manager, admin, or user, for example).
    - Give the user admin privileges or take them away.
4. Any modifications to user data are verified by the system, which also offers pertinent feedback (such as an error or success message).
