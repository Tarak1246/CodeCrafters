## User Story Title: Dashboard

As a dashboard developer, my goal is to create and install a dashboard module that shows project progress and personnel statistics, allowing customers to make data-driven decisions and track overall performance.

## User Story Description:

As a dashboard developer, I am responsible for developing a dashboard module for the system. The dashboard should visualize crucial indicators such as project progress and employee information. It should include graphs and charts. The dashboard should refresh dynamically in response to changes in the system's underlying data.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. Upon accessing the system, users should be directed to the dashboard page.
2. The dashboard should feature a pie chart displaying the distribution of active projects by status (e.g., ongoing, completed, pending).
3. A donut chart illustrating the employees assigned to projects, categorizing by project name or department, should be included.
4. A bar chart depicting the organizations contractors.
5. The dashboard should update automatically when new projects are added or existing projects are updated in the system.
6. The dashboard interface should be responsive and accessible on different devices and screen sizes.
