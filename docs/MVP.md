# Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Document

## Project Overview

* Project Title: Project TrackerÂ 

* Project Description: Project Tracker is a user-friendly role-based web application designed for project management in organizations. This application facilitating project, contract, and employee management. Admins and managers can add, edit, and delete projects, contracts, and employees, while approving user roles. The application tracks project details (ID, name, members, etc.), contract details (ID, name, category, etc.), and employee details (ID, name, type, project, etc.). All data will be visualized using charts. Our aim is to replace traditional methods like using Excel sheets, as this offers ease of access at fingertips, statistics, and secure authentication.

The intellectual merit of this is to provide ourselves with a thorough understanding of the software development process, as everyone engages in both development and testing roles. This approach ensures continuous improvement and adaptability, essential for timely project deployment. The broader impact of this method builds us ready for real-world IT challenges, fostering skills in agile methodologies and collaborative problem-solving.
