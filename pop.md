## Synopsis

Project Tracker is a user-friendly web-based platform designed for project management in organizations. It serves as a project tracking and external customer engagement application. The website maintains project details including client information, timelines, and updates. Our aim is to replace traditional methods like using Excel sheets, as this offers ease of access at fingertips, statistics, and secure authentication.

The intellectual merit of this is to provide ourselves with a thorough understanding of the software development process, as everyone engages in both development and testing roles. This approach ensures continuous improvement and adaptability, essential for timely project deployment. The broader impact of this method builds us ready for real-world IT challenges, fostering skills in agile methodologies and collaborative problem-solving.
